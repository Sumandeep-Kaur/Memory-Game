The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

At each turn: 
- Click on any card to reveal a symbol.
- Click on another card to find the matching symbol.
- If the cards matched, they stay flipped over.
- If cards does not match, they flip back to their original state.
